<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Monica Wojciechowski!</h1>
	<p>During the day, I'm a junior at Penn studying Systems Engineering and Behavioral Economics who enjoys the outdoors, country music, and cooking! But catch me late into the night and I'm a self-proclaimed "data artist" munching on Goldfish and designing away! This past semester, I was fortunate enough to have been named <a href="http://beacon.wharton.upenn.edu/wab/passion-projects-fellow-monica-wojciechowski/">Wharton "Passion Project" Fellow</a> to pursue my interests in data visualization, and couldn't be more excited about my first creations! <a href="/about">Read more about my life here!</a></p>
