It's amazing what some Google searches, (super helpful) online tutorials, and free time can turn into. My journey to learn data visualization started with my desire to share with the world the many "treasures" within data that are just waiting to be uncovered. Learning to create data visualizations using D3 was one step in the process. I definitely felt accomplished when I told my family and friends of my masterpieces (at least they are masterpieces in my geeky graphic-designer's data-driven perspective) and could swing my laptop around to show them off! It was not until recently though, that I realized I may not always be able to "swing my laptop around" to every viewer... it was time to build a website! 

The process of creating this site really intrigued me, so I did a little research- turns out by the time you finish reading this sentence, 4 new websites just have been launched. So, while my site might only be 1 of ~920,332,345 (its probably already grown since I typed in the number...), I couldn't be prouder of being that one.
