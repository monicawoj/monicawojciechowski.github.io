It's amazing what some Google searches, (super helpful) online tutorials, and free time can turn into! My journey started with my desire to share the "treasures" that data so cunningly hides with the world. Learning to create data visualizations using D3 was one step in the process and I definitely felt accomplished when I told my family and friends of my masterpieces (at least in my somewhat nerdy data-driven mind) and could swing my laptop around to show them off! It was not until recently, though that I realized I may not always be able to "swing my laptop around" to every viewer... it was time to make a website! The process of creating this site really intrigued me, so I did a little research-- turns out by the time you finish reading this sentence, 4 new websites just have been launched. So while mine might only be 1 of ~920,332,345 (its probably already grown...), I couldn't be prouder for being that one.
